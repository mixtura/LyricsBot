Curry from the fucking C9 nigga\nWe done toured the whole globe two damn times\nIt's safe to say this shit is mine, man we run it\n\n[Chorus: Denzel Curry]\nCatch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith\nCatch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em, nigga\nCatch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith\nCatch me on a zenith, catch me on a zenith that's the only time you'll see 'em",
